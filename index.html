                <p>The "Monster of the Ocean Depths" was meant to spawn in deep waters, it would use its tongue-like tentacle to pull you down and drown you. It was meant to bring more life to oceans.</p>

            <div class="mob-option">
                <img src="./images/phantom.png" alt="Mob B: The Phantom" width="250px">
                <p>The "Monster of the Night Skies" or as we now know it as the Phantom, was meant to be attracted by insomnia, fly around its prey and swoop down to attack its target. It was meant to be one of the few flying mobs that can spawn on the Overworld</p>

                <img src="./images/the-great-hunger.png" alt="Mob C: The Great Hunger" width="250px">
                <p>The "Great Hunger" was a cute-looking mob with a big mouth that would sink into the ground and hide, and would consume the enchantments from items or other mobs that happen to walk through its jaws.</p>

                <img src="./images/inferno.png" alt="Mob D: The Hovering Inferno" width="250px">
                <p>The Hovering Inferno was the fourth mob you could vote for, it was a more dangerous version of the <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Blaze">Blaze</a> and would be a strange encounter that would happen in the Nether, acting like some sort of mini-boss. It was meant to make the nether more scary and exciting.</p>

               <em>The life of a phantom is literally as valueless as a summer ant. It is a worthless, utter tumor of the sky. I have had to rescue too many inventories from people who passed out while out. The freedom of phantoms is an insult to me, I'd have them all in zoos</em>
