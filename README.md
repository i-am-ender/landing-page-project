# About the repo:  
This is a project from The Odin Project curriculum where the task is to build a landing page with 4 main content sections, images, and a footer.
I chose to base the page on a [Phantom](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Phantom) mob from the game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft) because it's a fun theme with enough content to meet the project requirements.
